Data Management &amp; Communication System for Educational Institutions using Google Spreadsheets

Databox is a basic school management system used to maintain school, department, staff, student and
parent profiles and their interrelationships hosted on Google cloud. The key is usage of Google Docs
[now Drive] as data source instead of traditional DB resulting in easier real time update of data [such as
assessments, assignments, attendance etc.] by users directly in Google spreadsheets.
